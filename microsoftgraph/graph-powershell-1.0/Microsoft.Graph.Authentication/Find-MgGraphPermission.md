# Find-MgGraphPermission

## SYNOPSIS
The Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK application requires users to have domain knowledge of both the semantics and syntax of Microsoft Graph API permissions used to authorize access to the API.
This cmdlet helps to answer the following questions:  - How do I find the values to supply to the permission-related parameters of commands like New-MgApplication and other application and consent related commands?
- What permissions are applicable to a certain domain, for example, application, directory?
To use Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK to access Microsoft Graph, users must sign in to an Azure AD application using the Connect-MgGraph command.
Use the Find-MgGraphCommand to find which permissions to use for a specific cmdlet or API.-  Currently PowerShell commands and scripts, including those implemented with Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK itself, have no way of validating user input that refers to permissions or providing "auto-complete" user experiences to help users accurately supply input to commands

```
PS C:\> Find-MgGraphPermission application
PermissionType: Delegated

Retrieves permissions related to a given domain.

### Example 2: Find the identifier for a specific permission
```
PS C:\> Find-MgGraphPermission application.Read | Format-List
Id             : c79f8feb-a9db-4090-85f9-90d820caa0eb
PermissionType : Delegated
Consent        : Admin
Name           : Application.Read.All
Description    : Allows the app to read applications and service principals on behalf of the signed-in user.

Id             : bdfbf15f-ee85-4955-8675-146e8e5296b5
PermissionType : Delegated
Consent        : Admin
Name           : Application.ReadWrite.All
Description    : Allows the app to create, read, update and delete applications and service principals on behalf of the signed-in user. Does not allow management of consent grants.

Id             : 9a5d68dd-52b0-4cc2-bd40-abcf44ac3a30
PermissionType : Application
Consent        : Admin
Name           : Application.Read.All
Description    : Allows the app to read all applications and service principals without a signed-in user.
```

Retrieves identifier for a specific permission.

## PARAMETERS

### -All
To return all possible permissions rather than just those that match the SearchString parameter, specify the All parameter.
The All parameter may also be used with the PermissionType to enumerate all applicaition permissions or all delegated permissions.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: All
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: False
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -ExactMatch
Specify the ExactMatch parameter to restrict the permissions emitted to those that exactly match the value specified for SearchString.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: Search
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: False
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Online
Specify the Online parameter in addition to SearchString to force Find-MgGraphPermission to update its set of permissions by requesting the latest permissions data from Microsoft Graph itself before searching for the permissions specified the SearchString parameter.
This ensures that Find-MgGraphPermission returns the most accurate search results as new permissions are added to Microsoft Graph for new APIs.
The command uses the existing access to Microsoft Graph as enabled by a previous invocation of the Connect-MgGraph command to issue the request for updated permissions.
If your current connection does not already have access to read this data from Microsoft Graph or if there is no network connectivity to Microsoft Graph, the command will fail.
If the command is successful in updating the set of permissions prior to searching for permissions, Find-MgGraphPermission will continue to use the updated list for all future invocations of the command even if they do not specify the Online parameter

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: False
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -PermissionType
Specify the PermissionType to determine whether application permissions, delegated permisisons, or both are returned by Find-MgGraphPermission.
By default, the value of this parameter is Any, which includes both delegated and application permissions.
Other valid values for PermissionType are Application and Delegated to return those specify types of permissions.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -ProgressAction
Treat this as a common parameter.

```yaml
Type: ActionPreference
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: proga

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -SearchString
The SearchString parameter allows you to specify a string such as 'user' or 'mail' that represents the subject or domain of the permission you're searching for.
Since permissions usually have names such as 'User.Read' or 'Mail.ReadWrite', the command uses the SearchString parameter to return all permissions that contain the value specified for SearchString in the name of the permission.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: Search
Aliases:

Required: True
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByValue)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### CommonParameters
This cmdlet supports the common parameters: -Debug, -ErrorAction, -ErrorVariable, -InformationAction, -InformationVariable, -OutVariable, -OutBuffer, -PipelineVariable, -Verbose, -WarningAction, and -WarningVariable. For more information, see [about_CommonParameters](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113216).

## INPUTS

### You can pipe permission names in the form of strings to Find-MgGraphPermission.
## OUTPUTS

### This command returns a collection of items with the following fields:
### * Name: The name of the permission as found in Microsoft Graph permissions reference documentation. Names will typically
### have a form like 'User.Read.All', or 'Files.ReadWrite' for instance.
### * Description: Provides a description of what access is granted by the permission
### * Id: The unique identifier for the permission in the form of a Guid. The unique identifier is required for using
### certain Microsoft Graph REST API resources or Microsoft Graph-based PowerShell commands that manage application consent.
### * Consent: Denotes whether the specified permission requires administrator or user consent. The valid values are 'Admin' and 'User'.
### * PermissionType: Valid values are 'Delegated' or 'Application' depending on whether the permission is one that is delegated by
### the user to the application ('Delegated'), or is directly assigned to the application without the consent of a user ('Application').
