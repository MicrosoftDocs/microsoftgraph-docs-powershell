# New-MgDomain

## SYNOPSIS

Adds a domain to the tenant.
Important: You cannot use an associated domain with your Microsoft Entra tenant until ownership is verified.
See List verificationDnsRecords for details.
Root domains require verification.
For example, contoso.com requires verification.
If a root domain is verified, subdomains of the root domain are automatically verified.
For example, subdomain.contoso.com is automatically be verified if contoso.com has been verified.

COMPLEX PARAMETER PROPERTIES

To create the parameters described below, construct a hash table containing the appropriate properties.
For information on hash tables, run Get-Help about_Hash_Tables.

BODYPARAMETER <IMicrosoftGraphDomain>: domain
  [(Any) <Object>]: This indicates any property can be added to this object.
  [Id <String>]: The unique identifier for an entity.
Read-only.
  [AuthenticationType <String>]: Indicates the configured authentication type for the domain.
The value is either Managed or Federated.
Managed indicates a cloud managed domain where Microsoft Entra ID performs user authentication.
Federated indicates authentication is federated with an identity provider such as the tenant's on-premises Active Directory via Active Directory Federation Services.
Not nullable.
 To update this property in delegated scenarios, the calling app must be assigned the Directory.AccessAsUser.All delegated permission.
  [AvailabilityStatus <String>]: This property is always null except when the verify action is used.
When the verify action is used, a domain entity is returned in the response.
The availabilityStatus property of the domain entity in the response is either AvailableImmediately or EmailVerifiedDomainTakeoverScheduled.
  [DomainNameReferences <IMicrosoftGraphDirectoryObject[]>]: The objects such as users and groups that reference the domain ID.
Read-only, Nullable.
Doesn't support $expand.
Supports $filter by the OData type of objects returned.
For example, /domains/{domainId}/domainNameReferences/microsoft.graph.user and /domains/{domainId}/domainNameReferences/microsoft.graph.group.
    [Id <String>]: The unique identifier for an entity.
Read-only.
    [DeletedDateTime <DateTime?>]: Date and time when this object was deleted.
Always null when the object hasn't been deleted.
  [FederationConfiguration <IMicrosoftGraphInternalDomainFederation[]>]: Domain settings configured by a customer when federated with Microsoft Entra ID.
Doesn't support $expand.
    [IssuerUri <String>]: Issuer URI of the federation server.
    [MetadataExchangeUri <String>]: URI of the metadata exchange endpoint used for authentication from rich client applications.
    [PassiveSignInUri <String>]: URI that web-based clients are directed to when signing in to Microsoft Entra services.
    [PreferredAuthenticationProtocol <String>]: authenticationProtocol
    [SigningCertificate <String>]: Current certificate used to sign tokens passed to the Microsoft identity platform.
The certificate is formatted as a Base64 encoded string of the public portion of the federated IdP's token signing certificate and must be compatible with the X509Certificate2 class.
  This property is used in the following scenarios:  if a rollover is required outside of the autorollover update a new federation service is being set up  if the new token signing certificate isn't present in the federation properties after the federation service certificate has been updated.
  Microsoft Entra ID updates certificates via an autorollover process in which it attempts to retrieve a new certificate from the federation service metadata, 30 days before expiry of the current certificate.
If a new certificate isn't available, Microsoft Entra ID monitors the metadata daily and will update the federation settings for the domain when a new certificate is available.
    [DisplayName <String>]: The display name of the identity provider.
    [Id <String>]: The unique identifier for an entity.
Read-only.
    [ActiveSignInUri <String>]: URL of the endpoint used by active clients when authenticating with federated domains set up for single sign-on in Microsoft Entra ID.
Corresponds to the ActiveLogOnUri property of the Set-EntraDomainFederationSettings PowerShell cmdlet.
    [FederatedIdpMfaBehavior <String>]: federatedIdpMfaBehavior
    [IsSignedAuthenticationRequestRequired <Boolean?>]: If true, when SAML authentication requests are sent to the federated SAML IdP, Microsoft Entra ID will sign those requests using the OrgID signing key.
If false (default), the SAML authentication requests sent to the federated IdP aren't signed.
    [NextSigningCertificate <String>]: Fallback token signing certificate that can also be used to sign tokens, for example when the primary signing certificate expires.
Formatted as Base64 encoded strings of the public portion of the federated IdP's token signing certificate.
Needs to be compatible with the X509Certificate2 class.
Much like the signingCertificate, the nextSigningCertificate property is used if a rollover is required outside of the auto-rollover update, a new federation service is being set up, or if the new token signing certificate isn't present in the federation properties after the federation service certificate has been updated.
    [PasswordResetUri <String>]: 
    [PromptLoginBehavior <String>]: promptLoginBehavior
    [SignOutUri <String>]: URI that clients are redirected to when they sign out of Microsoft Entra services.
Corresponds to the LogOffUri property of the Set-EntraDomainFederationSettings PowerShell cmdlet.
    [SigningCertificateUpdateStatus <IMicrosoftGraphSigningCertificateUpdateStatus>]: signingCertificateUpdateStatus
      [(Any) <Object>]: This indicates any property can be added to this object.
      [CertificateUpdateResult <String>]: Status of the last certificate update.
Read-only.
For a list of statuses, see certificateUpdateResult status.
      [LastRunDateTime <DateTime?>]: Date and time in ISO 8601 format and in UTC time when the certificate was last updated.

Otherwise, false if the domain is a subdomain or unverified.
Not nullable.
  [IsVerified <Boolean?>]: true if the domain completed domain ownership verification.
Not nullable.
  [Manufacturer <String>]: 
  [Model <String>]: 
  [PasswordNotificationWindowInDays <Int32?>]: Specifies the number of days before a user receives notification that their password expires.
If the property isn't set, a default value of 14 days is used.
  [PasswordValidityPeriodInDays <Int32?>]: Specifies the length of time that a password is valid before it must be changed.
If the property isn't set, a default value of 90 days is used.
  [RootDomain <IMicrosoftGraphDomain>]: domain
  [ServiceConfigurationRecords <IMicrosoftGraphDomainDnsRecord[]>]: DNS records the customer adds to the DNS zone file of the domain before the domain can be used by Microsoft Online services.
Read-only, Nullable.

  Microsoft Entra ID updates certificates via an autorollover process in which it attempts to retrieve a new certificate from the federation service metadata, 30 days before expiry of the current certificate.
If a new certificate isn't available, Microsoft Entra ID monitors the metadata daily and will update the federation settings for the domain when a new certificate is available.
