Note that this may not always be available or up to ````````````d````````````ate. For example, if a user changes their ````````````d````````````isplay name, the API may show the new value in a future response, but the items associate````````````d```````````` with the user won't show up as having change````````````d```````````` when using ````````````d````````````elta.
      - `[I````````````d```````````` <String>]`: Unique i````````````d````````````entifier for the i````````````d````````````entity.
