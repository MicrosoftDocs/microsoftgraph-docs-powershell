## PARAMETERS

### -AdditionalProperties
Additional Parameters

```yaml
Type: Hashtable
Parameter Sets: CreateExpanded
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -BodyParameter
The Role Definition resource.
The role definition is the foundation of role based access in Intune.
The role combines an Intune resource such as a Mobile App and associated role permissions such as Create or Read for the resource.
There are two types of roles, built-in and custom.
Built-in roles cannot be modified.
Both built-in roles and custom roles must have assignments to be enforced.
Create custom roles if you want to define a role that allows any of the available resources and role permissions to be combined into a single role.
To construct, see NOTES section for BODYPARAMETER properties and create a hash table.

```yaml
Type: IMicrosoftGraphRoleDefinition
Parameter Sets: Create
Aliases:

Required: True
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByValue)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```
