# Migrate from Azure AD PowerShell to the Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK

Use the information in this article to plan the migration of your applications in Azure AD PowerShell to Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK.

## Why Microsoft Graph PowerShell?

The following list summarizes the key advantages of using the Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK:

- **Access to all Microsoft Graph APIs**: Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK  is based on Microsoft Graph API. The Microsoft Graph API includes, in addition to Azure AD, APIs from other Microsoft services like SharePoint, Exchange, Outlook, etc, all accessed through a single endpoint with a single access token.
- **Supports PowerShell 7**: Microsoft Graph PowerShell module works with PowerShell 7 and later. It's also compatible with Windows PowerShell 5.1.
- **Cross-platform support**: Microsoft Graph PowerShell module works all platforms including Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- **Supports modern authentication**: Microsoft Graph PowerShell supports the Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) which offers more security. For example, you can use Passwordless sign-in experiences.
- **Open source**: Feature teams and the community can create great PowerShell experiences and share them with everyone.
- **Supports external identities**:
- **Uses least privilege**:
- **Receives monthly updates**: Microsoft Graph PowerShell commands are updated monthly to support the latest Graph API updates.
- **Advanced queries**: Microsoft Graph PowerShell supports rich Azure AD queries via eventual consistency.

## Upgrading to Microsoft Graph PowerShell

Scripts written in Azure AD PowerShell won't automatically work with Microsoft Graph PowerShell. The new cmdlet names have been designed to be easy to learn. Instead of using `AzureAD` or `AzureADMS` in cdmlet names, use `Mg`. For example, the old cmdlet `Get-AzureADUser` has become `Get-MgUser`. However, migration is more than just becoming familiar with the new cmdlet names. There are renamed modules, parameters, and other important changes.

To find the new cmdlets, see the [Cmdlet map](azuread-msoline-cmdlet-map.md).

### Document current scripts

Use the following criteria to check your scripts:

- Purpose
- Cmdlets used (inc. # of calls)
- Frequency of execution
- Importance
- Length
- Location
- Still required
- Improvement points (e.g. filter left, authentication, script analyzer, etc.)
- Score (optional)

### Update current scripts

- Start simple / low score
- Map cmdlets
- Map parameters / switches
- Map filters
- Check cmdlet documentation
- Human updates frequently occurring
- aka.ms/MSGraphExplorer
- Understand output objects
- Use dedicated apps and adhere to least privilege

To find the new cmdlets, see the [Cmdlet map](azuread-msoline-cmdlet-map.md).

### Convert your scripts

There is currently no tool to automatically converts scripts in Azure AD PowerShell to Microsoft Graph PowerShell. To convert your scripts manually from Azure AD PowerShell, follows the steps below:

1. Find the Microsoft Graph equivalent of your Azure AD PowerShell cmdlets from the [Cmdlet map](azuread-msoline-cmdlet-map.md).
1. Select the Microsoft Graph cmdlet to view the reference documentation and get the new syntax for the cmdlet.
1. Update your existing scripts using the new syntax.

> [!NOTE]
> Parameter names may not be the same in Microsoft Graph PowerShell. Consult the documentation to understand how to convert the parameters.

#### Example

The equivalent of the Get-AzureADUser cmdlet is [Get-MgUser](/powershell/module/microsoft.graph.users/get-mguser?view=graph-powershell-1.0&preserve-view=true). This cmdlet has additional parameters that let you do more with it's output e.g the ConsistencyLevel parameter that allows you to do `Count`, `Filter`, `Search` among others.

### Limitations

There are limitations that currently exist in Microsoft Graph PowerShell either by design or due to some functionality that is yet to be built in.

- There is not yet an equivalent of -SearchString for Get-AzureADUser, Get-AzureADGroup commands. Use -Filter instead. For example, `Get-MgUser -Filter "DisplayName eq 'Lee Gu'"` returns the user whose display name is equal to the specified string.
- Search does not yet work for any Azure AD commands.
- You need to use hash tables to pass nested parameters. Here is a sample of [Nested parameters](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-sdk-powershell/blob/dev/samples/9-Applications.ps1#L28-L43).
- **Pro-tip**: Use the Microsoft Graph PowerShell ConsistencyLevel parameter. It lets you do $count! This is best used for read-only scenarios and you need to be more careful when making changes. To learn more about the ConsistencyLevel parameter see [Advanced query parameters](/graph/aad-advanced-queries).

## Next steps

- [Uninstall AzureAD PowerShell](/powershell/azure/active-directory/install-previous-version): Uninstall the old module before installing the new one.
- [Install the Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK](/graph/powershell/installation): Follow these instructions to install the Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK.
