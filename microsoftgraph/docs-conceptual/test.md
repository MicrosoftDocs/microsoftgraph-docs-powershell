# Tutorial: Grant or revoke API permissions programmatically

::: zone pivot="grant-application-permissions"

When you grant API permissions to a client app in Azure AD, the permission grants are recorded as objects that can be accessed, updated, or deleted like other objects.

This can be useful for automation scenarios, bulk management, or other custom operations in your organization.
